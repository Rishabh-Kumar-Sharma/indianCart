Using React Icons in this project as a foreign library
Using Tailblocks(Tailwind Framework) for layouts
Update the url of the image in the database
Used React Toastify in 'Check Servicability'
Used CryptJS for cryptography of password
Used JWT(JSON Web Token for security of transfer of data) to transfer 
the details of the user into his/her account
Used '_document.js' to overwrite the pre-defined HTML so that the cart
which was visible all the time(and not supposed to be) is deliberately 
made: 'overflow-x-hidden' so that the cart can't be seen by default
There can be some situation in which a component in which a state variable is 
changing its state, doesn't get mounted or gets unmounted, in this situation an 
error : "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted 
component." will occur. This error was occuring in the __app.js page because of 
its 'Navbar' component. So, a change is done to the Navbar component:

    Initially, it looked like:
    const [key, setKey] = useState(0); 
        <Navbar
          logout={logout}
          user={user}
          key={key}
          cart={cart}
          addToCart={addToCart}
          removeFromCart={removeFromCart}
          clearCart={clearCart}
          subTotal={subTotal}
        />

    After correcting the error: 
        const [key, setKey] = useState();
        {key && (
        <Navbar
          logout={logout}
          user={user}
          key={key}
          cart={cart}
          addToCart={addToCart}
          removeFromCart={removeFromCart}
          clearCart={clearCart}
          subTotal={subTotal}
        />}

Used 'wrappixel' website for the pre-defined admin template
while starting to use this template, run: yarn install so that the nextjs gets imported there
using nodemailer for mailing in the case of forgot password
